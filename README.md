**To use SXF Themes you need to do these steps:**

1) Create a `theme.sxftheme` file next to `SynapseX.exe`
2) Open this file in any editor and paste the following content into it:

`{
  "MainWindow_GradientPanel": {
    "topColor": "R,G,B",
    "bottomColor": "R,G,B"
  }
}`

3) Then, edit the R, G and B values to match your prefered colors.
4) After that, save the file and restart SXF to completely apply the theme.
